# steamtricks

steamtricks provides workarounds for problems with Steam on Linux.

Valve has made it clear that support for the wider base of Linux distributions is not a priority. This has led to a number of suboptimal experiences for users not on an officially supported distribution. The goal of this project is to provide workarounds and solutions to those problems in an easy to use package. Currently, workarounds exist in some distribution packages and in various forums and the the like. This project aims to be the upstream source for packaging Steam fixes.
