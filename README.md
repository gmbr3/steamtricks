# steamtricks

steamtricks provides workarounds for problems with Steam on Linux.

Steam primarily targets Ubuntu and not the wider base of Linux distributions.
This has led to a number of suboptimal experiences for users not on an
officially supported distribution. The goal of this project is to
provide workarounds and solutions to those problems in an easy to use package.
Currently, workarounds exist in some distribution packages and in various forums
and the like. This project aims to be the upstream source for packaging Steam
fixes.
